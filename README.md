<h1>GameDev3 Wiki Repository</h1>

This is a repository for a small project ambitiously named **GameDev3** or **GD3**, which is a new paradigm for approaching game development.  It was started in late 2023 around the same time Game Arts International Network (GAIN) launched their [comics/whitepaper "If you don't like the game, change the rules."](https://gameartsinternational.network/if-you-dont-like-the-game-change-the-rules/) about setting up a dev studio as a workers' cooperative.  In fact this project was principally inspired by that body of work.

Now at the start of 2024 this wiki will start collecting similar information, or information about any new way individual game devs or small dev studios are trying to make themselves more successful, without having to slave themselves to some capital-provider who is more concerned about counting their beans than making good games.

It is our hope this collection helps devs and small dev studios make themselves more commercially successful while staying creatively fulfilled.
